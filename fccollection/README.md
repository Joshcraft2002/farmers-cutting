# Farmer's Cutting Collection
Adds more [Farmer's Delight (NeoForge)](https://modrinth.com/mod/farmers-delight) or [Farmer's Delight Refabricated (Fabric)](https://modrinth.com/mod/farmers-delight-refabricated) cutting board recipes for various mods. This is a single data pack combining all the Farmer's Cutting packs for those who would rather download one pack rather than multiple, at the cost of possibly having unusable recipes.

All compiled packs are listed and linked to below (actual content depends on minecraft version):
